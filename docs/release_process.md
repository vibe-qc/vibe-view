# Release process

vibe-view is independently versioned. Development changes land on the canonical
GitLab main branch through the existing contributor and review process.
Released tags are immutable. Do not rewrite published history or move a
release tag to repair documentation or packaging metadata.

## Contributor evidence

Follow the repository's CONTRIBUTING.md and developer test guidance. A change
needs the relevant tests and validation comparisons, with commands, selected
source revision and results recorded for review. A release blocker or a fix to
an incorrect numerical result requires an independent check before closure.
Keep new release notes under Unreleased; preserve released changelog sections.

AI-assisted changes follow the same disclosure, attribution, licensing and
validation requirements as other contributions. Assistance does not replace
review or evidence. See the existing contributor policy for the full contract.

## Maintainer publication

The release owner selects scope and version only after the required gates
pass. The agentic loop coordinates the source tag and supported publication
jobs. Site-specific commands, accounts, destinations and gate-operation
runbooks are maintained in the private operations repository. Contributor
source archives do not contain or install those operational scripts.

A public source snapshot has its own commit identity and records the original
source revision and per-file checksums. It contains no private development
ancestry. A correction is published as a new snapshot or patch release;
existing source tags remain unchanged. Public availability is established by
successful anonymous access and the publication verification report.
